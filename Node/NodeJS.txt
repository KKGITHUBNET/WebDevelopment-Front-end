Node.JS
 - JavaScript Runtime (Not a language or framework)
 - Built on V8 JavaScript Engine (Same as google chrome)
 - Written in C++
 - Essentially allows us to run JavaScript code on Server
 - Not so useful with CPU intensive apps(long running cals). for that specialised java, python back end is recommended
 - Supports many concurrent connections
 - Works  on single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
 - Rest API and Microservices
 - Real time services (Chat,Live Updates)
 - CRUD apps - Blogs, shopping carts, social network
 - Goes well with MongoDB

Event Loop
 - Single threaded
 - EventEmitter class is used to bind events and listeners
	

NPM
 - Installs third party packages(framework, libraries, tools etc)
 - npm : node package manager
 - packages get stored in "node_modules" folder
 - all dependencies are listed in a "package.json" file
 - npm init : generates package.json file
 - npm install express : installs a package locally
 - npm scripts can be created to run certain tasks such as run a server etc.
 - npm install -f nodemon  : installs package globally
 
Node Modules
 - Node Core Modules - path, http, fs
 - Custom Modules - file
		- const path = require('path')
		- const myFile = require('./myFile')
 - Node comes with "read eval print loop REPL" which allows javascript program to be run directly in console.
