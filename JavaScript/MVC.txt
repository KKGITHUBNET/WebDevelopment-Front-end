Controller

 - handles the request flow and tells the rest of the server what to do with the request
 - Acts as a middle-man for model and view 
 - Controller should not contain much of the code/logic.
 - Controller asks the model to get the data based on the request
 - never interacts with the data and uses model to interact with the data
 - Failure and Success request logic is coded in controller
